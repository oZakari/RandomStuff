<#To execute would require the following permissions:
Microsoft.Insights/ActivityLogAlerts/Read
Microsoft.Insights/ActivityLogAlerts/Write
Microsoft.Insights/ActionGroups/Read
Microsoft.Insights/ActionGroups/Write
Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/Read
Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourcegroups/Write

NOTE - If you only need standard ARM roles like Owner and Contributor you could instead simply target the ARM role for email via policy, e.g. for the action group targets
NOTE - This will NOT work if they are groups. If groups have the roles you will need to use this script approach
For the template to deploy use https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/demos/monitor-servicehealth-alert/azuredeploy.json and replace the emailReceivers part with:
"armRoleReceivers": [
    {
        "name": "Email Owner",
        "roleId": "8e3af657-a8ff-443c-a75c-2fe8c4bcb635",
        "useCommonAlertSchema": true
    },
    {
        "name": "Email Contrib",
        "roleId": "b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c",
        "useCommonAlertSchema": true
    }
]

To output a list of all your subscription IDs using Resource Graph you can use
resourcecontainers
    | where type=='microsoft.resources/subscriptions'
    | project subscriptionId

If debug and want to see verbose
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"

** Note This script is based on a RBAC role assigned. If you use PIM and RBAC assignment is not useful
it would be easy to change the script to look for a subscription level "Owner" or "Contact" tag you set
which could then be read and the values added to the action group!
